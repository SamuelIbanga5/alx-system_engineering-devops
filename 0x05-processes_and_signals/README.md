# Processes and Signals

In this project, I learned about handling process ID's and signals in Bash with `ps`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `exit`, and `trap`.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
-  0. What is my PID
	- [0-what-is-my-pid](https://github.com/SamuelIbanga5/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x05-processes_and_signals/0-what-is-my-pid): Bash script that displays its own PID.
- 1. List your processes
	- [1-list_your_processes](): Bash script that displays a list of currently runnin processes.
	**Requirements:**
	> Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
	> Display in a user-oriented format
	> Show process hierachy
