# Regular Expressions

### What is a Regular Expression
A Regular expression commonly called a **regexp**, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching(i.e it operates like a **find and replace** command). Wile it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.
For this project, we are tasked to build our regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default.
**Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.**
