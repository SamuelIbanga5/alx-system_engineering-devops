0. OSI Model
	- [0-OSI_model](https://github.com/SamuelIbanga5/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/0-OSI_model): OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
1. Type of Network

2. MAC and IP Address
	- [2-MAC_and_IP_address](): Media Access Control (MAC) is known as the unique identifier of a Network Interface while an IP address is known as the unique identifier of a computer on the internet.
