# Networking Basics

## What is a Network?
A network consists of two or more computers being linked either physically with cables or via a Wi-Fi connection. By being linked, these computers can share their resources, files, or internet connection without manually connecting on each occasion.

## Tasks
0. OSI Model
	- [0-OSI_model](https://github.com/SamuelIbanga5/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/0-OSI_model): OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
1. Type of Network
	- [1-types_of_network](https://github.com/SamuelIbanga5/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/1-types_of_network): There are about 7 different types of Network categorized by the scope or scale of the network.
2. MAC and IP Address
	- [2-MAC_and_IP_address](https://github.com/SamuelIbanga5/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/2-MAC_and_IP_address): Media Access Control (MAC) is known as the unique identifier of a Network Interface while an IP address is known as the unique identifier of a computer on the internet.
3. UDP and TCP
	- [3-UDP_and_TCP](https://github.com/SamuelIbanga5/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/3-UDP_and_TCP): User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a protocol used by apps to deliver a faster stream of information by doing away with error-checking while Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a protocol that provides apps a way to deliver (and receive) an ordered and error-checked stream of information packets over the network.
4. TCP and UDP ports
	- [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](https://github.com/SamuelIbanga5/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x07-networking_basics/4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): Bash script that displays listening ports showing only listening sockets and showing the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
5. Is the ost on the network
	- [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](): Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
